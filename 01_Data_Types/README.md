## 2. Comments

Comments are explanatory notes in your code. They are **ignored** by the Python interpreter and exist purely for human readers.

### 2.1 Single‑Line Comments

Use `#` to start a comment that lasts until the end of the line:

```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello!")  # This prints "Hello!"
```

### 2.2 Multi‑Line Comments (Docstrings)

Use triple quotes (`"""..."""` or `'''...'''`) for longer notes or function/module documentation:

```python
"""
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span multiple lines.
"""
print("Welcome!")

'''
This is also a multi-line comment.
Commonly used for docstrings.
'''
```
